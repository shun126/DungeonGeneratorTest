# ðŸ¤” Why Dungeon Generator?

One day I wanted to create a video game, but I didn't have the level design know-how. So I decided to create a procedural dungeon generator.
The dungeon generator was based on Vazgriz's algorithm. You can read more about [Vazgriz's algorithm here](https://vazgriz.com/119/procedurally-generated-dungeons/).
